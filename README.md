# Fuel Symphony - Fuel Station Management System

This is a comprehensive management system for fuel stations, supporting multiple user roles and functionalities.

## Setting Up Supabase Database

1. Create a new Supabase project
2. Go to the SQL Editor in your Supabase dashboard
3. Copy and paste the SQL from `supabase_schema.sql` into a new query
4. Run the query to set up all tables, functions, and security policies
5. Create your first Super Admin user through the Supabase Auth UI or API

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project with the following variables:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

Replace `your_supabase_url` and `your_supabase_anon_key` with your actual Supabase project URL and anon key.
